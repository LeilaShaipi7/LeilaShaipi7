## About Me
My name is Leila Shaipi and I go to Nora Frances Henderson school in the graduating class of 2025. I hope to pursue accounting, real estate, or radiology at either McMaster, Toronto, or Waterloo. My favourite class in school is functions and my favourite sport is Soccer. I play on a regional team outside of school. I also like to workout in my spare time and play the piano.
